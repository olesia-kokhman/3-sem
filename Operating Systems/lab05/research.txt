For the past quarter century, Sue Riddlestone has been a leader in the sustainability movement, pushing the national and global agenda on advancing more sustainable production and consumption. Sue’s early career saw her launch multiple successful sustainable businesses, including Bioregional, and the UK’s renowned eco-community, BedZED. Building on that experience, Bioregional created the One Planet Living framework – a set of guidelines that became a key influence in the creation of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. Today the framework is promulgated and supported by a global Bioregional Network of organisations and projects that inspire individuals, institutions and governments to reduce their footprint and create happier, healthier and more sustainable communities.

The Person
Sue was born in Surrey, UK, one of two daughters. Her father, a property salesman, died when she was five and Sue was raised by her mother, a secretary. Sue was passionate about animals and environmental issues from a young age but despite attending a selective grammar school was steered towards limited career options as a woman and decided to train as a nurse. 


In her mid-twenties Sue became very concerned about the terrible negative impact that human consumption and pollution was having on wildlife and the natural world, particularly through pollution of our seas, and loss of old growth forests such as Clayquot Sound in Vancouver. Sue felt a calling to do something about it. Following the birth of her third child, Sue decided not to return to nursing, and instead began volunteering for Greenpeace, where she set up a successful local fundraising and campaigning group. Sue started taking an increasingly lobbying and advocacy stance, setting up local campaigns as part of a network of young mothers against unethical food production systems and starting a small company selling washable nappies. By the time Sue was in her late-twenties, she had established or was on the board of four groups or social enterprises.


As she reached thirty, with her children now at school, Sue decided she wanted to set up a green business. She was determined to find ways to produce the things people need in more efficient, closed loop models, taking a localised bioregional approach. Sue wanted to show that this could be done and be part of the mainstream of our economy. She began work with paper and textile alternatives and co-founded Bioregional to research, develop and implement these new green businesses. She established a working closed-loop paper model for London which reduced paper impact by 93%, and established the Laundry, London’s first kerbside recyclables collection for SMEs. The research and development Sue pioneered moved forward the knowledge about localised paper pulping through the MiniMill company, and on hemp textile production. 


Sue is always inspired by the possibility to do truly sustainable, ground-breaking things when she can envisage them: when her organisation Bioregional needed a new office Sue asked why they couldn't build themselves a green office. So began the BedZED eco-village project which, as a world-leading green building project, has led to much recognition and success for Sue and her colleagues. She has devoted herself to expanding this work ever since, always working with others to create world-leading sustainable homes and communities, products and services. 


In 2008, Sue was shocked when she heard directly from an IPCC scientist that we could no longer avert climate change.The grief Sue experienced when she heard this impelled her to take her work to the highest levels at the UN. She wanted to share that we can live better lives in our sustainable future, and how urgent it is. This led to Sue’s successful work as part of the global team that created and secured the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015. 


Today, Sue is equally passionate about achieving the Goals and has dedicated the remainder of her career to achieving them, and the Paris agreement, by 2030. Sue likes to focus at all times on both the local and the global. She works on practical real-life projects such as building eco-homes or sustainable products. At the same time, she advocates at a strategic national and international level, drawing on these real-life stories to help deliver policy and systems change. 


Sue is a humble, passionate person whose relationship-building skills and mentoring ability enable her to continue to grow her advocacy work, as well as her Bioregional and One Planet Living approaches. She is a Schwab and Skoll Awardee, and received an OBE from the Queen in 2013 for services to sustainable business and to the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

The New Idea
The multiple constituencies needed to drive sustainability require people and institutions who have legitimacy and familiarity to work across government, corporations and the environmental movement. For the past 25 years, Sue has pioneered programme and policy advances addressing sustainable production and consumption. Working at the level of individuals, communities, corporations and national governments, she has methodically scaled Bioregional's effective sustainability tool and communication approach, One Planet Living, from one UK community to the United Nations level, playing a pivotal role in influencing the Sustainable Development Goals. 


The One Planet Living approach continues to show people how to make sustainable living actionable and desirable, with Sue delivering her model through strategic, high-impact partnerships. This model was developed through the learnings BedZED eco-village, which Sue instigated in the 1990s - the first of their kind in the UK. One Planet Living comprises ten easy-to-grasp, interconnected and holistic principles, alongside detailed goals and guidance. Used in combination, they give clear, practical guidance on creating sustainability guidelines and planning for a project, organisation, city or region.
