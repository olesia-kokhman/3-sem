Research examining the health impacts of criminalisation often focuses on how police enforcement affects health outcomes and access to existing services. Grounded in a UK-case study, we demonstrate how assemblages across police, (local) government, immigration, health, and social-care systems can discipline and remove vital services from the most marginalised sex workers, while disregarding their broader vulnerabilities to violence, precarity, and lived expertise. By (re)producing precarious and life-threatening conditions, and dictating whose safety, health, and needs matter, these assemblages reflect necropolitics in action. They undermine principles of inclusion health and community involvement, and contradict purported goals of protecting vulnerable women, maintaining community safety, and reducing health inequalities. We follow participants’ calls for social justice approaches, with a redistribution of resources from sex-work-related enforcement towards specialist and peer-led services that recognise, respond to, and represent sex workers’ diverse realities.
